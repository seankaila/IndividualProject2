## Brief 
This project is intended to demonstrate the knowledge from training with QA. To do this I was tasked to create an application that generates an object based upon a set of predefined rules, testing the application though unit testing & deploying the application using github ations. Terrafrom will be used to reate the resources used for the project (Four Webapps & One Mysql Database). Data generated by these services will then be stored in a mySQL database hosted in Azure.

## Architecture

### Database Table

Once a users asks a question, their question and the systems responces are recorded to a mysql database. This Diagram descibes the entities inside the database used in the project. As we can see the Table is uisng an ID as a primary key to uniquely identify rolls of data from a table. The Question and Answer entiy uses strings as data types and the probability is represented using the data type of an integer.

This diagram describes how a user will typically use the system.

## Project Management 

### Kanban Board
To track and understand the progress of my project I used Azure Devops to create a Kanban Board. This board was split up into different sections.

- Epics: These are high level categories each user story refers to. 
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123100387-fd667f80-d42a-11eb-93eb-679ada12d48e.png)
- User Stories: These are derived from the Epics, detailing what a user whatâ€™s to do and why they want to do that action. 
- Tasks: These contain low level tasks needed for a user story / epic to be deemed completed.

#### Kanban Board layout: 
- New: Here User stories that needed to be started were stored here.
- Active: stories that were currently being worked on.
- Closed: User stories and tasks that were completed.

### Risk Management

A simple risk assessment was performed during the project. Each risk was described and evaluated along with a rating to understand the severity of the risk. To expand upon this, I provided an update to each risk checking to see if they changed in anyway.
