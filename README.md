## Brief 
This project is intended to demonstrate the knowledge from training with QA. To do this I was tasked to create an application that generates an object based upon a set of predefined rules, testing the application though unit testing & deploying the application using github ations. Terrafrom will be used to reate the resources used for the project (Four app services & one Mysql Database). Data generated by these services will then be stored in a mySQL database hosted in Azure.

## Architecture

### Database Table
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/122677807-da925c00-d1db-11eb-8f42-a9390cb9b6b3.png)
Once a users asks a question, their question and the systems responces are recorded to a mysql database. This Diagram descibes the entities inside the database used in the project. As we can see the Table is uisng an ID as a primary key to uniquely identify rolls of data from a table. The Question and Answer entiy uses strings as data types and the probability is represented using the data type of an integer.

### Use Case Diagram 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123182724-f15cdb00-d487-11eb-9912-2fe8cac91abd.png)
This diagram describes how a user will typically use the system. As a user i will have access to a home page. Here the user will be able to "ask a question" then be sent to an answer page where they recive a response. This responce contains: The Question, an answer and a probability and the ability to ask another question. The user will then have the oppotunity to view the past questions and answers along with the probability assigned to them. This is the history page.

### Service Archetecture Diagram
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123182394-3af8f600-d487-11eb-90bf-6dd8cd1c4c57.png)
This service archetecture diagram describes the how the data blows from each api to the end user. As we can see service 2 & 3 generate a random answer and character respectively. Service 4 then gets that data and concatinates it. Service 4 then produces a probability based on service 3s response. Therefore service 1/ The frontend gets service fours output (Concatinated answer & probability) and saves it to a MySQL databse. The front end interacts with this database by reading and writing this data. 

## Project Management 

### Kanban Board
To track and understand the progress of my project I used Azure Devops to create a Kanban Board. This board was split up into different sections.

- Epics: These are high level categories each user story refers to. 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123100387-fd667f80-d42a-11eb-93eb-679ada12d48e.png)
- User Stories: These are derived from the Epics, detailing what a user whatâ€™s to do and why they want to do that action. 
- Tasks: These contain low level tasks needed for a user story / epic to be deemed completed.

#### Kanban Board layout: 
- New: Here User stories that needed to be started were stored here.
- Active: stories that were currently being worked on.
- Closed: User stories and tasks that were completed.

#### Full User Stories
- As a user I would like to ask a question to the application. So that I can get a response generated by service 4.
- As a user I expect to see all past questions displayed on a separate page. So that it will be easier to scroll though the history of all the past questions and answers. These past questions will be pulled from an MySQL database.
- As a user I would like to see the response from a question  that was asked on the home screen on an answer screen. So that I can see the Question asked, Answer and probability in a separate view.  Response should be saved to a MySQL database for later use. 
- This service should call service 2 & 3, then concatenate the responses . Assigning it a variable called Answers. So that when the API is called it gives the correct response.
- As a user i want the probability generated from the output of service 3. For example: When A is outputted the probability of 100 is given.
A = 100, B = 80, C = 60, D = 40, E = 20 (Anything else is 404). So that users can see the probability of their answers actually being true.
- As a user I want the output of this service to give me one of these possible answers: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E". So that we can understand the quality of the randomly generated answer.
- As a user i want the output of this service to give me one of these possible answers: "It is Certain", "Without a doubt", "You may rely on it", "Most likely", "Don't count on it", "My reply is no", "My sources say no", "Very doubtful". So that the app creates a feeling of a real 8 ball. 

### Risk Management
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123129184-a7ea9c80-d443-11eb-8a28-66a212532bcd.png)
A simple risk assessment was performed during the project. Each risk was described and evaluated along with a rating to understand the severity of the risk. To expand upon this, I provided an update to each risk checking to see if they changed in anyway.


## Testing
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123129423-d799a480-d443-11eb-8b87-cb056eb5409f.png) <br/>
Like the last project, the AAA testing pattern was used to create appropriate tests for each service of the project. As we can see, all 13 tests passed spanning 4 different countrollers (3 web apis & 1 web app). A range of tests were included within this project. For example: Testings what would happen if a user didnt enter a question. 

### Code Coverage Report
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123132743-f77e9780-d446-11eb-8bff-5bd020554cd5.png)
From the summary above we can see that the overall code coverage of the project is sitting at a strong 73.4%. This is a massive improvement from the last project as code that shouldnt be tested isnt being covered by the report generator. Giving us a better understand of the potential areas of consern. This number could have been higher but the views havent been tested. This negatively affecting the coverage. To Test the views, integration testing was be taught but due to time it wasnt. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123133520-b935a800-d447-11eb-9353-162a0c0bf30e.png)
As we can see every controller tested had a code coverage of 100%. This a really good because it means that main logic within the app doesnt have any run times errors. But may be suceptable to logical errors that i didnt account for or see. A way to fully understand the logical errors would be by conducting integration tests, which encoperate inputs from the front end.

Strangly, one area not being covered in my tests was this history class. Used for mapping data for the database. The class above is being referenced by two tests but its not being coverded by the code coverage. This is something i cannot explain.

## Terraform
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123146727-1f292c00-d456-11eb-9310-1bcde8ccb128.png)
To build the resource group, all four app services and the MySQL database above, i used terrafrom. This allowed me to create all of these resources using code instead of the GUI. This is a great way of creating objects in Azure because its faster and more efficient. Allowing me to also make changes the whats on azure if something needs changing. For example: Adding in a "project: true" tag so that my app services and MySql Databse doesnt get deleted at 6pm. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123146885-50096100-d456-11eb-95b5-f01375396191.png)
The screenshot above shows me susessfully making a change to my terraform highlighting that one change has been made. This was done by running the commands "Terrafrom plan" prep the chanfes then "Terrafrom apply" to finalize the changes.

## Continuous Integration Pipeline and Best Practices

### CI Pipeline 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123141608-788e5c80-d450-11eb-9300-dfca8ade3840.png)
Using GitHub actions I was able to deploy my project to my app services in azure. To do this i used four yml files. One for each service and one for the actual asp.net web app. To make this process look a lot less complicated and easier to follow, i should have used one yml file instead of four.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123142389-47faf280-d451-11eb-920a-7a305e7a3d59.png)
As we can see the yml files does multiple jobs, getting the project ready to publish and deploy. From the screenshot above, we can see that the build job is just checking for any before going into the test job. 

### Best practices
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123172859-a5089f80-d475-11eb-823c-6ef8f14f6df0.png)
During this projects life cycle, i adhered to multiple best practices. For example: Documenting code with in line comments, describing what certain things operations do. This was done so that people outside the project could really understand how certain functions / operations worked if they were ever to take the project off my hand and expand upon it. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123173183-1e07f700-d476-11eb-8628-967be0116c5f.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123173352-62939280-d476-11eb-8a0e-e285585aef7b.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82107182/123173449-8525ab80-d476-11eb-99e2-793413de7c17.png) <br/>
Another example of best practices can be seen in my use of GitIngore. For security reasons i didnt push certain files up to git hub. For Example: My terrafrom files. This is because they contain sensative information. My Main.tf contained connections strings that contained password and other sensative information surrounding my databse. These ignores were done at the very start of the project. So that there was no chance that individuals could go back though the commits and find sensative information. From the screenshots above we know these files are being ingnored because the text is greyed out on visual code (A red circle is used on visual studio). Anything that wasnt neccesary wasnt pushed up.

A very simple branching model was used within this project. As the user requirements were so small, i didnt feel the need to do a Git flow branching model like my previous project. Instead using a couple of branches to version control my work. 


## Known Issues & Futher Improvements
- The yml file that deploys the project needs to condenced down into one file so that it easer to understand and manage the deployement in the future. 
- On the an IOS device a user can refresh the answerpage by "submitting the form again" button producing multiple entries to the database.To fix this i would do some further testing with mobiles in mind.
- Find a way to test the views in the future. As the front end is just as important as the back end and needs testing too.
- Make use of variables more iffesiently in terraform files. As a smiple sulition of duplicating the same Webapp with a different name was used. Therefore there is redundant configuration in each webapp at this moment of time.
