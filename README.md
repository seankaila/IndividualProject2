## Brief 
This project is intended to demonstrate the knowledge from training with QA. To do this I was tasked to create an application that generates an object based upon a set of predefined rules, testing the application though unit testing & deploying the application using Continuous Integration & Azure. Data generated by these services will then be stored in a mySQL database hosted in Azure.

## Architecture

### Database Table

Once a users asks a question, their question and the systems responces are recorded to a mysql database. This Diagram descibes the entities inside the database used in the project. As we can see the Table is uisng an ID as a primary key to uniquely identify rolls of data from a table. The Question and Answer entiy uses strings as data types and the probability is represented using the data type of an integer.

This diagram describes how a user will typically use the system.

## Project Management 

### Kanban Board
To track and understand the progress of my project I used Trello to create a Kanban Board. This board was split up into seven different sections.

- Epics: These are high level categories each user story refers to. 
- User Stories: These are derived from the Epics, detailing what a user whatâ€™s to do and why they want to do that action. 
- Tasks in progress: These contain low level tasks needed for a user story / epic to be deemed completed. 
- Tasks completed: Tasks that are completed. 
- Issues: Issues within the project that need attention
- Issues resolved: Backlog of previous issues that are no longer a problem.

### Risk Management

A simple risk assessment was performed during the project. Each risk was described and evaluated along with a rating to understand the severity of the risk. To expand upon this, I provided an update to each risk checking to see if they changed in anyway.

## Version Control Continuous Integration Pipeline and Best Practices

### Version Control
During the duration of the project, I was using a feature branch model to manage the version control aspect of the project. As you can see, I used a three-branch system to do this. These branches were: Main, dev and feature. I had multiple feature branches that were used when adding a new feature to the application. Once a feature was complete, it was then merged with the dev branch. Once a group of features were merged to the dev branch that were free from error, I would then merge the dev branch to the main. This main acted as a live version of my product. Only containing code which was fully functional / bug free.
